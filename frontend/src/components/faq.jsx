      question: "Which parameters are monitored?",
      answer:
        "We currently monitor Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), Nitrate, and Fecal Coliform levels.",

    {
      question: "WHY REAL-TIME DATA?",
      answer:
        "Real-time monitoring of parameters like DO, BOD, nitrate, and fecal coliform helps detect pollution early and supports better decision-making.",

    {
      question: "WHY FORECASTING?",
      answer:
        "With a 3-day forecast, authorities and citizens can take preventive steps before water quality deteriorates further.",

    {
      question: "How often is the data updated?",
      answer:
        "The system fetches the last 10 days of recorded data along with a 3-day forecast for each monitored location.",
    },
    {
      question: "What triggers an alert?",
      answer:
        "Alerts are generated if any parameter crosses predefined thresholds (e.g., DO < 5, BOD > 3, Nitrate > 10, Fecal Coliform > 500).",

      question: "Can I use this data for research or projects?",

        "Yes! The data can be freely used for research, reports, and awareness campaigns. Please credit our platform when doing so.",
